I have a few ideas on increasing engagement for sustainability cell:
1) We could post electricity consumed per student monthly or weekly(if we could get the data) to increase awareness
2) Could post regular quiz questions on Instagram regarding sustainability in general. Ex: How much food is wasted daily in India?
3) Conduct Treasure hunts/ Poster-making comp etc
4) Can conduct a Competition among hostels for donation of old stuff to be re-processed or donated..whichever hostels gives more wins 
5) we can create an alternate Instagram page where we can post memes regarding sustainability in IITB. (might shame some hostels a bit)
